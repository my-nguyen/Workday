# Workday

I didn't have enough time to complete the project. In addition, the API all of a sudden returns null for my "trending" fetch even though it was working 2 minutes before and I didn't change anything, and trying out the url on a browser works.

I wrote an XML and a skeleton DetailActivity but didn't have time to test it because of the null problem above.

Needless to say I didn't have time to do the back button, the search feature, or write it in Kotlin.
